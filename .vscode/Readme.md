## VSCode Configuration for C++ projects
This setup includes:

- Compiler: /opt/homebrew/bin/g++-15
- IntelliSense: matches Homebrew GCC headers
- Output directory: handled by tasks / Code Runner (output/)
- No more missing header issues (like <bits/stdc++.h>)

### c_cpp_properties
Use c_cpp_properties.json for IntelliSense & include path. Which property does what:

- "compilerPath"	Points to Homebrew GCC 15 (/opt/homebrew/bin/g++-15)
- "intelliSenseMode"	Uses GCC mode for Apple Silicon (arm64) — change to "macos-gcc-x64" if on Intel Mac
- "includePath"	Lets IntelliSense find headers within your workspace
- "macFrameworkPath"	Required for system includes (macOS SDK headers)
- "browse.path"	Adds Homebrew’s GCC include directories for accurate IntelliSense
- "configurationProvider"	Helps VS Code resolve system headers automatically if you use Makefiles later

### Difference b/w tasks.json and launch.json

- tasks.json: Defines build and run tasks (what commands VS Code executes, like g++, ./program, etc.).
- launch.json: Defines debug configurations — how VS Code launches the debugger (which program to run, environment, arguments, etc.).

Together launch.json can call a task from tasks.json before debugging (via "preLaunchTask"). So:
- tasks.json = compile or run commands
- launch.json = debug/run configuration
Now pressing F5 will: Compile using your GCC build task.  


About .dSYM folders. You’ll see directories like: main.out.dSYM/  
These are debug symbol files generated by macOS’s lldb/clang tooling (and even GCC on macOS).
They contain symbol info (function names, line mappings) for debugging. Needed only for debugging (F5). Safe to delete if you’re not debugging.
To hide them (and still keep them for debugging). Add to .gitignore: `*.dSYM/`

Or disable generating them by removing the `-g` flag in `tasks.json`
```
"args": [
  "-std=c++17",
  "-Wall",
  "${file}",
  "-o",
  "${workspaceFolder}/output/${fileBasenameNoExtension}.out"
]
```
But that disables debugging symbols (not ideal if you use breakpoints).

### settings.json

What this does:
- Compiles using /opt/homebrew/bin/g++-15
- Builds into output/<filename>.out
- Runs the binary automatically
- Hides .dSYM folders from the sidebar
- Keeps your file saved + terminal interactive

GCC won’t create folders automatically.
So if /output doesn’t exist, add a small pre-step in the command:
```json
"cpp": "mkdir -p \"$workspaceFolder/output\" && /opt/homebrew/bin/g++-15 -std=c++17 -Wall -g \"$file\" -o \"$workspaceFolder/output/$fileBasenameNoExtension.out\" && \"$workspaceFolder/output/$fileBasenameNoExtension.out\""
```  
If you’re mostly running programs (not stepping through with the debugger), you can safely remove debug symbols to prevent .dSYM directories from being generated. To do that, remove -g from the Code Runner command:
```json
"cpp": "mkdir -p \"$workspaceFolder/output\" && /opt/homebrew/bin/g++-15 -std=c++17 -Wall \"$file\" -o \"$workspaceFolder/output/$fileBasenameNoExtension.out\" && \"$workspaceFolder/output/$fileBasenameNoExtension.out\""
```
